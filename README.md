## About

This tool simulates a TCP flood attack by creating tons of fake TCP connections to a target IP and port.  
It's designed to help **new hackers, cybersecurity learners, and script kiddies** understand:

- What a DDoS attack looks like
- How a basic TCP flooder works
- Why protection matters (CDNs, firewalls, rate limiting)

ðŸ’£ Great for local testing, VPS stress checks, or ethical experiments in your own lab.
